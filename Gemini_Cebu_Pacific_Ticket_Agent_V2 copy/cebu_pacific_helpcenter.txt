# What to Expect During Tarmac Delays

## Overview

### Description
EffectiveMarch 15, 2024,Cebu Pacific follows thiscontingency planto ensure your comfort and safety during long tarmac delays. This is in line with the Joint Memorandum Circular No. 001 issued by the Department of Transportation (DOT), Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), and Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA).
What Is a Tarmac Delay?A tarmac delay happens when:
- Your plane is waiting on the runway or taxiway for two (2) hours or more, either before takeoff or after landing; and
- You are not allowed to get off the plane due to safety, security, or air traffic control reasons.
What the Pilot Will Do During a DelayThe Pilot-in-Command (PIC) is responsible for keeping you informed and comfortable. During a tarmac delay:
- You’ll receive updates every 30 minutes about the reason for the delay and any changes; and
- The cabin crew will do their best to make sure you're comfortable while waiting.
Getting Off the Plane (Deplaning)If the tarmac delay reaches three (3) hours, the pilot will begin letting passengers off the plane unless:
- It's unsafe or not allowed by airport authorities;
- Air traffic control says moving the plane would disrupt airport operations;
- The flight is expected to take off within 30 minutes after the three (3) hour mark;
- There's no clean and safe area at the airport to accommodate passengers who get off.
- If needed, Cebu Pacific may decide to return to the departure airport or land at a different airport to let passengers off safely.
Food and DrinksOnce the tarmac delay reaches two (2) hours, the cabin crew will start handing out food and water. If supplies are limited, priority will be given to:
- Passengers with special needs
- Passengers with small children
- Senior citizens and pregnant women
- If more food is needed, the cabin crew will request additional supplies from Cebu Pacific. For international flights, any unused pre-ordered meals may also be distributed.
Onboard ComfortWhile you're waiting on the plane, Cebu Pacific will make sure that:
- Toilets are working;
- Air conditioning is functioning; and
- Medical help is available if needed
At the Airport After Getting OffIf passengers are allowed to get off the plane:
- Cebu Pacific's team will work with the airport staff to make sure there's a clean and safe waiting area.
- Special attention will be given to:Passengers with special needs;Parents with small children;Senior citizens and pregnant women;Unaccompanied minors; andPassengers with connecting flights.
- Passengers with special needs;
- Parents with small children;
- Senior citizens and pregnant women;
- Unaccompanied minors; and
- Passengers with connecting flights.
- Food, water, and communication services will be provided to passengers.
- Updates will also continue every 30 minutes until the flight resumes.
Need to Call Someone?If you've gotten off the plane, you can use the airport station's official phone to contact family or make arrangements for your next flight.
Reporting to AuthoritiesCebu Pacific will submit a report to the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) and Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) within three (3) days of any long tarmac delay. This report will explain why passengers couldn't get off the plane and include supporting documents.
