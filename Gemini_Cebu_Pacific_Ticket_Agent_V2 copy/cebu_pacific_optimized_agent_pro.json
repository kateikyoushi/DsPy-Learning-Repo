        "query": "pwede ba mag-rebook ng flight kapag natanggap ko ang Flight Swap offer? at magkano ang bayad?",
        "reasoning": "The user is asking in Tagalog if they can rebook a flight after accepting a \"Flight Swap\" offer and how much it costs. Based on standard airline policies regarding Flight Swap (a voluntary program where passengers move to a different flight in exchange for incentives), once a passenger accepts the swap, the new flight is confirmed. Rebooking after this is generally allowed but subject to the standard fare rules of the new ticket, including change fees and fare differences.",
        "answer": "Opo, maaari ka pa ring mag-rebook ng iyong flight kahit natanggap mo na ang Flight Swap offer. Gayunpaman, narito ang mga dapat mong tandaan:\n\n1. **Rebooking Fees:** Ang pag-rebook pagkatapos ng Flight Swap ay ituturing na isang regular na voluntary change. Maaaring may kaukulang **Change Fee** depende sa uri ng iyong ticket.\n2. **Fare Difference:** Kung ang pamasahe sa bagong petsa na pipiliin mo ay mas mahal kaysa sa iyong kasalukuyang flight, kakailanganin mong bayaran ang **Fare Difference**.\n3. **Terms and Conditions:** Ang mga insentibo o voucher na nakuha mo mula sa Flight Swap ay karaniwang hindi na mababago o mawawala depende sa terms ng offer.\n\nPara malaman ang eksaktong halaga, maaari mong i-check ang \"Manage Booking\" sa aming website o app para makita ang breakdown ng fees bago mo i-confirm ang pagbabago. Maaari mo ring kontakin ang aming customer support para sa mas detalyadong asistensya."

To provide a helpful response, I need to confirm that rebooking is generally allowed but subject to certain conditions such as timing (at least 2 hours before the flight), potential change fees, and fare differences. I should also guide them on how to do it via the website or app.",
        "answer": "Opo, maaari ninyong i-rebook ang inyong flight. Narito ang ilang mahahalagang paalala para sa pag-rebook:\n\n1. **Timing:** Maaari kayong mag-rebook hanggang dalawang (2) oras bago ang nakatakdang oras ng inyong paglipad.\n2. **Fees:** Maaaring may kaukulang rebooking fee at fare difference (kung mas mahal ang bagong flight na pipiliin ninyo).\n3. **Paano gawin:** Maaari ninyong gawin ito sa pamamagitan ng \"Manage Booking\" section sa aming website o mobile app. I-enter lamang ang inyong Booking Reference Number at apelyido.\n\nKung ang inyong flight ay nakansela o nagkaroon ng schedule change na higit sa tatlong oras mula sa airline, karaniwan ay libre ang rebooking sa loob ng 30 araw."
