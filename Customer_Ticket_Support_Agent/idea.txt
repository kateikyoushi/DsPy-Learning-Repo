STEP 1: Show the Problem
  → Display real messy support ticket
  → Run unoptimized agent (generic, unhelpful response)
  → Time: 5 minutes, Accuracy: 30%

STEP 2: Show DSPy Optimization
  → Load 50 past tickets with good resolutions
  → Run MIPROv2 optimization (3-5 minutes)
  → Show optimized instructions + few-shot examples

STEP 3: Show the Results
  → Re-run same ticket with optimized agent
  → Detailed, step-by-step solution with code snippets
  → Time: 30 seconds, Accuracy: 85%

STEP 4: Show Business Impact
  → Calculate: 1000 tickets/day × 4.5 min saved = 75 hours/day
  → 75 hours × $30/hour = $2,250/day = $821K/year savings
  → ROI: Infinite (optimization costs ~$1)
