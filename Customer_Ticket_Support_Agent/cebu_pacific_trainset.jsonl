Booking Period vs Travel Period (Most Common)**\n- ❌ **Booking Period**: Dates when you can USE the promo code to book\n- ✅ **Travel Period**: Dates when you can actually TRAVEL\n- Example: Promo valid for BOOKING until March 31, but for TRAVEL April 1 - June 30\n\n**Check This:**\n- When are you trying to FLY? (not when are you booking)\n- Promo codes usually have specific travel dates\n\n**2. Minimum Spending Requirement**\n- Many promos require minimum ₱2,000 - ₱5,000 spend\n- Are you booking enough seats/flights to meet minimum?\n\n**3. Route Restrictions**\n- Some promos only work on specific routes\n- Example: \"Domestic flights only\" or \"Manila to Visayas routes only\"\n- CEBUPROMOFLY: Check if valid for your selected route\n\n**4. Seat Availability**\n- Promo fares have LIMITED seats per flight\n- Once sold out, promo code won't work even if valid\n\n**5. Technical Issues**\n- Try these fixes:\n  * Enter code in ALL CAPS: CEBUPROMOFLY\n  * Remove spaces before/after the code\n  * Clear browser cache and cookies\n  * Try different browser (Chrome, Firefox)\n  * Use mobile app instead of website\n\n**6.
